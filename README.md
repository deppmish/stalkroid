Stalkroid - The asteroid stalker for Space Apps Challenge 2014 by NASA
=========

This project deals with the need of understanding the path, types and different sizes of asteroids as they possess the dangers for future human civilization. Asteroids impact have been known to wipe out civilizations, atleast two evidence support this, one of the famous being of Dinasaurs. They have changed the course of evolution many times and are responsible for the diversity of the life in planet as we know today. Not all asteroids possess the threats. It depends on the frequency and the magnitude of asteroid impact, and the orbital path it follows. We are still at amateur level as far as asteroid study is concerned. Everyday, we discover new families of asteroids and their orbital paths. Hence, it has to be studied with greater purpose.
